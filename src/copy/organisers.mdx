## What you attendees expect from you

You should keep your attendees informed the schedule for future
events.

You're free to organize anything from happy hours (consider
non-alcoholic drinks as an option though!) to hackathons to everything
in-between. If your event includes speakers, make sure to give
speakers a time limit!

## Words of Wisdom

Organizing an event takes lots of work. Things you'll want to consider
include: venue, catering, sponsors, co-organizers, speakers,
volunteers, timing, rsvp management, and more!

Your own company may host and sponsor events and are welcome to give
address attendees during the event.
